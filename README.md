# Bootstrap Practice, for the first time!

## Instructions:
#### Using Bootstrap, create the homepage for the Zoo
Include the following details:
* Navbar with Logo(text) and links to three areas of the zoo.
* Feature 3 animals with image, title, copy
* Include a footer with additional links to other zoos.
* Article about the new area, conservation details, or events.
   * Try out a button group
   * Try out a form inputs.

## Current Thoughts:
Bootstrap is interesting, but I'm struggling to understand its usefulness when it takes so many classes to get a desired look, but then the padding and margin are still off? I found myself getting incredibly frustrated trying to figure out how to get things to look right when a few moments in my own CSS file could have fixed that problem immediately. I think what I'm starting to understand is that Bootstrap should be used for templating, and colors and such should be manually added. I can see how this would be most efficient. Hopefully this is correct.
